<span class="graybox fa18">Financial Support Plan</span>
<br />
<br />
<p>Accident or illness can financially ruin a family. In case of any mishap to you, your dependents will be entitled to fixed monthly financial support as per company policy. This will ensure that they will be able to have a regular source of income and will be free from financial worries. In case of death, since we cannot recover the loss of life we make sure on our part that the financial support you were extending to your family still continues for a consistent time period.
